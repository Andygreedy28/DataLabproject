		Hong Kong's external merchandise trade statistics are compiled based on information contained in import/export declarations. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is a separate customs territory, as stated in "The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China". Import/export declaration is also required of Hong Kong's merchandise trade with the mainland of China, and statistics relating to this are included in Hong Kong's external merchandise trade statistics.
		Figures may not add up to total due to rounding.
		Territory/Region with nil records is omitted.
		For imports, the country/territory of consignment is the country/territory from which the goods were consigned, by any form of transport, to Hong Kong, without any further intermediate commercial transaction.
